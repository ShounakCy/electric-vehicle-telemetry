General
=======

There is no time limit for this challenge. However, we expect you to return it within a few days (unless communicated otherwise). You don't have to spend more than 3 hours on it, such as one evening, we know everyone is busy! You will not be penalized if you spend more time (please let us know if you do).

We kindly ask that you do not share this take-home challenge or any related materials with others. This ensures a fair and consistent evaluation process for all candidates.

There are no "trick questions," and no prior knowledge of specific data or systems is required (please share if you have expertise or extensive experience in the specific area of the question). You are expected to apply common sense and learn as you go.

Do not overcomplicate your solutions or answers. Focus on the most important aspects and avoid going down unnecessary rabbit holes. Do not spend excessive time polishing or "productionizing" your solutions unless explicitly instructed to do so.

The tasks are open-ended, and there are no specific answers or scripts expected as part of the solution. You can use your preferred tools, scripts, visuals, programming languages, etc., to complete the tasks. Please submit any scripts or other artifacts you used along with your solution whenever possible.

The Challenge
=============

You are provided with three data files, each containing a week of artificially simulated telemetry data for a single e-scooter. Such data is used to inform business decisions in fleet operations and management, as well as to support research and development efforts for improving hardware and performance, and to improve customer experience.

You should spend most of your time on tasks #1 and #2. You can assume that the data quality is good, and that the data is complete and consistent. The sensors are not faulty.

1. Analyze the Data

Determine whether any of the e-scooters might have a different hardware configuration, and explain your reasoning. If you believe any of the e-scooters have the same hardware configuration, provide an explanation for that as well.

2. Enhance the Data

The provided simulated data does not account for weather conditions. Your task is to enhance the simulated data by adding outside temperature (you can make up its actual values) to make the data more realistic and useful.

If time permits, create a re-usable tool/script that can enhance a data file (assuming the same format as the ones provided) with simulated outside temperature. Suggest potential performance optimizations for the tool/script.

3. Discussion Only

What additional elements or data points are missing from the dataset that would make it significantly more useful to drive business decisions in fleet operation context. Specify which missing elements are most critical and briefly explain why.
